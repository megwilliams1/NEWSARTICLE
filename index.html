    <h3>Record High Heat </h3>

    <p>The ocen is to big to ignore. We are in danger of losing what makes the ocean such an special place to so many of us. 
        There is more than our own wellbeing at risk â€”ocean ecosystems and wildlife are also at stake. 
        Coral reefs are dying off and could be eradicated completely by the end of the century; the essential sea ice of the Arctic is disappearing, threatening Arctic animals and ecosystems; and even fish will decline as their populations shrink and move in search of cooler water.
